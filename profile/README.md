### After the FTX saga I'm moving 100% defi - so, reprogramming all my bots to work exclusively with dYdX

Jambo! and welcome! These are non opinionated trading bots using various strategies to trade crypto assets. The word **akili** means brain or mind in Swahili. The objective here is to make it the most intelligent bot in existence that has as many advanced features as possible, but which at the same time can be used by your typical crypto trader with basic experience.

This, as with all projects was born out of frustration on the lack of features with commercial bots out there. They always missed that little tweak that in my mind would make things a lot more better, and hopefully profitable.

Let's get the usual out of the way...
